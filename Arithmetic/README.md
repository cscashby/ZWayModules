##Rationale
I badly miss a function in HA to manipulate data from virtualDevice sensors. So$
Arithmetic replaces and improves on module Mathematica.

###Functions
This is a very simple module, which supports *addition*, *subtraction*, *multip$
The module creates a virtualDevice which hold the result of the operation. As i$

###Experimental function
20150615 Added a calibration function that acts on the first sensor. Its value $

result = sensor1 * constant1 + constant2
