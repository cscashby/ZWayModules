##Rationale
I badly mis a function in HA to manipulate data from virtualDevice sensors. So I decided to make a simple proof of concept: module Arithmetic.
Arithmetic replaces and improves on module Mathematica.

###Functions
This is a very simple module, which supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two inputs.
