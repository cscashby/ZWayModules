# ZWayModules
This is my collection of more and less mature ZWayModules. Some of them are published in the [ZWay App-store](http://developer.z-wave.me/?uri=public#/web/apps).

Credit for the base module code goes to [pz1](https://github.com/pz1) whose [XMLDevice](https://github.com/pz1/ZWayModules/tree/master/XMLDevice) inspired the JSON and Tado modules.
