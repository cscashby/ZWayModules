## ZWayModules
My collection of ZWayModules some are general (OpenRemoteHelpers) some more specific for one type of external device (PVLogger, SolQoS) In general they are described in more detail at the Zwave.me forum under http://forum.z-wave.me/viewforum.php?f=3424  
The module.json files of each module has links to the individual recipes.
