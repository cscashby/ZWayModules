##XMLDevice
This module has been derived from the OpenWeather module. It is meant to turn a single XML element into a virtual device. In the configuration screen the user has to specify a number of parameters that defines the virtual device. It is important to adhere as close as possible to standard terminology as defined in the opt/z-way-server/translations/scales.xml file from Z-Way.
